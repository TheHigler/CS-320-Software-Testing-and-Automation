How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Proper testing procedures is a great way to ensure a piece of software is functional and secure. Well written tests allow you to check if the methods, classes, and constraints you used are functioning properly. I'm a big fan of the coverage tests; I was able to see the aspects within my code I hadn't created tests for or had tested properly. I would say the best way to ensure testing is properly done is to have someone else either test it or look at your tests. This will prevent any bias' that may exist and it never hurts to have a fresh set of eyes on a project. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I feel the best way to interpret user needs is through thorough note taking and utilizing comments within the code for the more pertinent requiements. For instance, the variables in our projects all had constraints of being not null, updatable, and a certain length. I used comments either above or next to those variables so I could easily check to make sure I was creating methods that accomodated the appropriate variable constriants. 

How do I approach designing software?

I feel the best way to approach software design is ensuring you have effective and informative system diagrams. Well written and thought out diagrmas will allow you to see how the flow of information should exist within the system as well as the different classes and class structures that will need to exist. These diagrams will allow multiple people to work on a single project and be on the same page as well as ensuring all aspects of the system end up within the code.
